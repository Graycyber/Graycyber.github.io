# HTB: Optimum

***Overview**: Optimum is an easy rated HTB machine which mainly focuses on enumeration of services with known exploits. Both exploits are easy to obtain and have associated Metasploit modules, making this machine fairly simple to complete.*
## Scanning and Enumeration

- So we scan for open ports and services and just identified port 80

- Navigating to the web server, we are presented with the below, we also identified that HttpFileServer 2.3 is running on the target

![](assets/Optimum_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231112160630.png)

- we can see the login option, so if we click it we are asked for credentials

![](assets/Optimum_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231112160935.png)

- if we cancel attempt to login or enter wrong credentials, we are brought with this

## Exploitation

- searching for vulnerabilities for this version, we are presented with an RCE

![](assets/Optimum_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231228000724.png)

- so utilizing the exploit at [https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49584](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49584), we modify the IPs and port

![](assets/Optimum_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231112162915.png)

- then we execute the exploit and get a shell

![](assets/Optimum_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231112163025.png)

- we can view the user flag

## Privilege Escalation

- we can view the system information

- we can also get more information about who we are and what privileges we have

```shell
PS C:\Users\kostas\Desktop> whoami /all

```

- we can also obtain a shell using metasploit which will make it easier to upload files

![](assets/Optimum_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231112173450.png)

- if we run the sysinfo, we will see that we are in a x86 shell so we need to migrate to an x64 process

![](assets/Optimum_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231112190746.png)

- we run `ps` to identify the process we want to migrate to

![](assets/Optimum_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231112190720.png)

- then we can migrate to the explorer process

![](assets/Optimum_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231112190807.png)

- then we can upload our winpeas script

![](assets/Optimum_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231112173315.png)

- and run the script

```
.\winPEASx86.exe -FullCheck
```

![](assets/Optimum_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231112173334.png)

- we can also run exploit suggester in metasploit using `run post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester` and specifying the session ID

![](assets/Optimum_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231112191049.png)

- we've identified some priv_esc exploits and running the exploit `ms16_032_secondary_logom_handle_privesc`, we successfully elevated privileges

![](assets/Optimum_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231112192940.png)

- now we can view the root file
