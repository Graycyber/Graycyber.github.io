# HTB: Blue

***Overview**: Blue is an Easy rated windows machine on Hackthebox that exploits the popular SMB vulnerability (EternalBlue: MS17-010) to gain compromised access as System on the machine.*
## Scanning and Enumeration

- we start off by scanning for open ports and services

![](assets/Blue_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230213215745.png)

- then we go ahead to also run a vulnerability scan on these services, and we identify that the SMB version is vulnerable to MS17-010

## Exploitation: EternalBlue

- utilizing the eternalblue exploit in module, we then set the options

- then go ahead and run the exploit

- we have access as NT AUTHORITY, so we have successfully exploited the machine

- but metesploit usually gives us an x86 shell so we have to migrate to an x64 process
- so we run the `ps` command to see which processes are running as NT authority

- we can then migrate to any of the processes, in this case Ec2Config.exe process using  `migrate 1656`

- and we have migrated successfully

## Post Exploitation: Pillaging
- so now we can dump hashes using the hasdump

Jon:1000:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:ffb43f0de35be4d9917ac0cc8ad57f8d:::
```

- we can then crack the hashes using 

```shell
hashcat -m 1000 --status -o found.txt hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

- and we found a password alqfna22
- the first flag is stored in the root directory as usual
- the third flag is found in Jon directory

- the 2nd flag is stored is stored where paswords are usually stored in windows which `C:\Windows\System32\config`, so if we move to the directory, we can vie the flag
